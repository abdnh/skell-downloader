# SKELL Downloader

A Python script to download example sentences from [SKELL](https://skell.sketchengine.eu/) (Sketch Engine for Language Learning).

WIP and not tested much yet.

I mainly want to use this in my [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) add-on [InContext](https://github.com/abdnh/anki-incontext/) or in a separate new add-on that I plan to write.

## TODO

- [ ] docs
- [ ] get frequency data
- [ ] command-line interface?
